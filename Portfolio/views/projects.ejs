                    <li>
                        Nowadays students use bus passes for their daily traveling to school/college
                        and to renew and issue the bus pass is a very tedious and time-consuming
                        process.
                    </li>
                    <li> 
                        For this small work, the user has to go personally to the bus station, which is
                        very time-consuming.
                    </li>
                    <li> 
                        Students have to stand in a queue, which is a very tedious process, and still
                        in today’s modern world traditional method is followed.
                    </li>
                    <li> 
                        The solution had been implemented in megacities, but not in every village
                        and city, for this issue in Gujarat, India.

                    <li> 
                        To reduce the effort of students by providing them such a platform through
                        which they can easily generate/renew their bus passes at any time and
                        anywhere at their fingertip.
                    </li>
                    <li> 
                        To rectify the traditional workflow and provide students(modern youths)
                        their fair chance to use and get more familiar with the technology.
