      <h3>Problem Summary</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Nowadays students use bus passes for their daily traveling to school/college
          and to renew and issue the bus pass is a very tedious and time-consuming
          process.
        </li>
        <li>
          For this small work, the user has to go personally to the bus station, which is
          very time-consuming.
        </li>
        <li>
          Students have to stand in a queue, which is a very tedious process, and still
          in today’s modern world traditional method is followed.
        </li>
        <li>
          The solution had been implemented in megacities, but not in every village
          and city, for this issue in Gujarat, India.
        </li>

          anywhere at their fingertip.
        </li>
        <li>
          To rectify the traditional workflow and provide students(modern youths)
          their fair chance to use and get more familiar with the technology.
        </li>
        <li>
          We are trying to make the system user-friendly and efficient in time-saving.
        </li>
        <li>
